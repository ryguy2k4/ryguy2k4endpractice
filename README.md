# Ryguy2k4's End Practice Map

Hello! This is a map I have created to practice one-cycling and end fights. I know there are already well established end practice maps in the community like Jojoe's Perch Practice and Emma's One Cycle Map, but mine is a little different. My map combines the core features of both of those maps into one while personalizing it to my own tastes and adding much more room for personal preference in the many settings you can choose. The main draw in my opinion is that this map has so many customizable settings and has BOTH one-cycling practice AND perch/end fight practice in one map.

### I'll start with the improvements in my map vs Jojoe's end practice. 
* I always had some terrain in Jojoe's map that would not reset (fixed in mine)
* You could not assign items to hotbar and inventory slots with Jojoe's loadout customization (you have the option to in mine)
* Mine includes option to spawn at the edge of the island or next to the fountain
* Mine includes option to instant reset if you fail the one cycle
* Mine includes option to have a far dragon, close dragon, or random (see [T_Wag's video](https://youtu.be/0cQXHpDi8ps?t=262) for more info)
* Mine includes option to automatically force the dragon to perch if it has not by 3min, 2min, 1.5min, 1min, or 30sec

### And Improvements in my One Cycle Practicerer vs Emma's Epic End Practice
* Whenever I loaded in her world I would be in the fountain and would have to do /kill to reset the map (fixed in mine)
* I always thought the method for customizing the fountain setup in her map was a little janky so I tried to make mine more straightforward
* Mine includes a customizable loadout
* Emma's map used east/west perches, mine uses north/south
* Emma's map only had 25 different dragon heights, mine has over 2500
