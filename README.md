# Ryguy2k4's End Practice Map

Hello! This is a map I have created to practice one-cycling and end fights. This is a fun project of mine that I am so happy so many people like. Bug reports and feature requests are always appreciated! Contact me at ryguy2k4#9371 [Download Here!](https://github.com/ryguy2k4/ryguy2k4endpractice/releases/download/v2.0.0/Ryguy2k4.End.Practice.v2.0.zip)

I am currently working on v2.1.0, it will include a menu system like the one in Llama's bastion practice, improved loadout editors, and a few important bug fixes. So make sure to come back here and get it when it comes out!


### One Cycle Practice
* Simulates north/south perches with over 2500 different dragon heights
* Choose from 4-9 beds or a custom loadout
* Create custom fountain setups for anchor cycles and whatnot
#### The following also apply during the one-cycle in perch practice
* Option to show dragon head distance (arbitrary number)
* Option to show dragon health in the sidebar
* Option to show dragon damage messages in the chat
* Option to put notches in the bossbar

### Perch Practice
* 5 different end islands to practice on
* Customizable loadouts in game (or within the datapack for extra customizability)
* Option to resummon the dragon (takes 30 sec) in order to better simulate the fight
* Option to have a far dragon, close dragon, or random (see [T_Wag's video](https://youtu.be/0cQXHpDi8ps?t=262) for more info)
* Option to spawn at the edge of the island or next to the fountain
* Option to instant reset if you fail the one cycle
* Option to automatically force the dragon to perch if it has not by 3min, 2min, 1.5min, 1min, or 30sec
* Option for a phase display

I plan on making my own portal practice map next, all the current ones have big inconveniences that make practicing not as easy as it should be imo.
