# Ryguy2k4's End Practice Map

Hello! This is a map I have created to practice one-cycling and end fights. This is a fun project of mine that I am so happy so many people like. Bug reports and feature requests are always appreciated! Contact me at ryguy2k4#9371 

### [Tutorial Video](https://youtu.be/2IKzwVIvJdQ)

### One Cycle Practice
* Simulates north/south or diagonal perches with 7.5 trillion different dragon heights
* Choose from 4-9 beds or a custom loadout
* Create custom fountain setups for anchor cycles and whatnot
* Save dragon heights to practice over and over
* Toggle end crystals being there or not
#### The following also apply during the one-cycle in perch practice
* Option to show dragon head distance (arbitrary number)
* Option to show dragon health in the sidebar
* Option to show dragon damage messages in the chat
* Option to put notches in the bossbar
* Option to instant reset if you fail the one cycle

### Perch Practice
* 5 different end islands to practice on
* Easily customizable loadouts in-game
* Option to resummon the dragon (takes 30 sec) in order to better simulate the fight
* Option to have a back dragon, front dragon, or random (see [T_Wag's video](https://youtu.be/0cQXHpDi8ps?t=262) for more info)
* Option to spawn on the obsidian platform or then edge of the island
* Option to automatically force the dragon to perch if it has not by 3min, 2min, 1.5min, 1min, or 30sec
* Option for a phase display
